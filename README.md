# Manufacturing Downtime Analysis

# Objective  -

1. Calculate the efficiency for a production line and break it down by operator.
2. Use a Pareto chart to identify the main factors for downtime in the production line.
3.  Use a matrix to calculate the total downtime by operator for each of the main factors you identified.

# Overview -  

This project investigates production line efficiency to uncover key downtime causes and identify improvement areas. The analysis includes calculating operator-specific efficiency, prioritizing main downtime factors with a Pareto approach, and evaluating downtime by operator and factor using a matrix. Based on these findings, targeted recommendations were made: initiating machine adjustment training for all operators, providing specialized batch change training for Mac, and implementing preventive maintenance checks to reduce machine-related delays.


# Findings -

1. Overall Efficiency Sits at **64%**
2. Operator Charlie has the highest efficiency at **67%**.
3. The Top 5 Factors account for **80%** of the Downtime.

   > Machine adjustment
   
   > Machine failure  

   > Inventory shortage  

   > Batch change  

   > Batch coding error  

4. 3/5 main downtime factorsÂ are due to **operator error**.


# Calculations -  
```
1. In Line productivity -

   Batch Time  =( End Time - Start Time ) * 24 * 60 
   Min batch time = XLOOKUP(B2,Products!A:A,Products!D:D)

2. In Downtime factors -

   Downtime =SUM(INDEX('Line downtime'!$C$3:$N$40,,MATCH(A2,'Line downtime'!$C$2:$N$2,0)))
   Pareto   =SUM($D$2:D2)/SUM($D$2:$D$13)```

3. In Line downtime -

   Operator =XLOOKUP(A3,'Line productivity'!C2:C39,'Line productivity'!D2:D39)

4. In Dashboard -
 
   Matrix with the operators as the rows and the main downtime factors as the columns

  =SUMIFS(INDEX('Line downtime'!$C$3:$N$40,,MATCH(Dashboard!C$23,'Line downtime'!$C$2:$N$2,0)),'Line downtime'!$B$3:$B$40,Dashboard!$B25)
```

# Recommendations -
1. Start with machine adjustment training for all operators.
2. Provide Special batch change training for Mac.
3. Apply Preventive maintenance to machines and double check.
